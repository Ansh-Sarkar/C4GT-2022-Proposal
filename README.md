# Implementation Of A NFT Based, Scalable, Accreditation / Badge Rewarding System

**Proposal for [C4GT](https://www.codeforgovtech.in/) 2022 | Project Idea: Competency Passbook | [Ansh Sarkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ansh-sarkar/) | Date: 4th June 2022**

## Synopsis

The boom in blockchain technology and Indiaâ€™s prominent **2nd position** in the world crypto landscape has taken the world by storm. Decentralized databases beyond the authority of central institutions, based on mathematically backed **gossip discovery** and **peer-to-peer (p2p)** consensus algorithms have revolutionized supply chains, storage, identity verification, etc, and have led to the development of trustless Decentralized Apps **(DApps)** and even entire Decentralized Autonomous Organizations **(DAOs)**. With this huge radius of impact, it should not come as a surprise that even the education sector has not and should not remain untouched. This proposal is one such attempt to extend the **power of NFTs** on blockchains to the Indian Education System to power reward-based and personalized learning on a **national scale**.

The proposed idea leverages **Web 2.0 - 3.0, CLI, REST API Development, System Design,** and **Data Storage** technologies to enable the development of an accreditation/badge-based rewards system. The badges/certificates/rewards, in this case, represent NFTs that are mined on a secure, private blockchain network made up of a collection of **independent institutional nodes** running on the Golang implementation (one of the first 3 implementations) of the Ethereum protocol derived from a common genesis block. The **Puppeth CLI** (Command Line Interface) is used to facilitate the creation and configuring of genesis blocks, boot nodes, and various other aspects of the custom-built private blockchain. Proposed implementation details and **Scalable High-Level system Designs (HLDs)** have been discussed in the proposal.

The real-world implementation of the above-mentioned system includes a **passive central authority** that acts as a **boot node** and facilitates the discovery of peer nodes when a new node is introduced. Every node in this private blockchain corresponds to an **Independent Ethereum Node run and maintained by an institution**. The consensus algorithm used is **PoA or Proof Of Authority**. The modular nature of the proposed system allows it to seamlessly merge and connect to other public blockchains which implement the **Ethereum standards** and support **Smart Contracts in Solidity**. This private blockchain is then used as a source of authenticity to verify the awarded badges/certificates thereby creating a **distributed blockchain-based competency ledger** available to all stakeholders at all times.

**Keywords:** Blockchain, Scalable, Competency Ledger, Ethereum Protocol, PoA
